# DAX Measures and KPI Logic

## Win Rate

Calculated as the proportion of closed opportunities that were successfully won.

Formula logic:
Won Deals ÷ Total Closed Deals *100

Notes:
Open opportunities are excluded to avoid distortion.

## Stage Conversion Rate

Calculated as:
Opportunities at current stage ÷ Opportunities at previous stage

Applied only to progressive pipeline stages.

## Deal Cycle Time

Calculated as the number of days between opportunity creation and close date.

Measured only on closed opportunities for comparability.
